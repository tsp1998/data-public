> #### Q: JavaScript Features 
>  A: 
> - It is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
> - It is designed for creating network-centric applications.
> - It is complementary to and integrated with Java.
> - It is an open and cross-platform scripting language.
> #### Q: JavaScript Advantages 
>  A: 
> - Less server interaction
> - Immediate feedback to the visitors
> - Increased interactivity 
> - Richer interfaces
> #### Q: Variable Scopes 
>  A: 
> - Global
> - Local
> #### Q: JavaScript code can be injected in HTML in ways 
>  A: 
> - Inline
> - Internal
> - External

>  A: 
> - Object
> - Number
> - String
> - Boolean
> - Undefined
> #### Q: Javascript at server side 
>  A: Yes with some runtimes: node, deno, etc.
### Node Questions
> ==================
> #### Q: Node 
>  A: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the clientâ€™s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.
> #### Q: Why Node 
>  A: 
> - It is generally fast
> - It rarely blocks
> - It offers a unified programming language and data type
> - Everything is asynchronous 
> - It yields great concurrency
> #### Q: Node used for 
>  A: 
> - Real-time chats
> - Internet of Things
> - Complex SPAs (Single-Page Applications)
> - Real-time collaboration tools
> - Streaming applications
> - Microservices architecture
> #### Q: Most commonly used libraries 
>  A: 
> - Express
> - Mongoose
> #### Q: Express (if knows about express which node developer must) 
>  A: Express is a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications
> ### React Questions 
> ===================
> #### Q: React 
>  A: React is component based library which helps in building reusable UI components. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.
> #### Q: React Features 
>  A: 
> - JSX
> - Components
> - Virtual DOM
> - One-way data-binding
> - High performance (may be)
> #### Q: Why React instead of other frameworks like Angualr 
>  A: 
> - Easy creation of dynamic applications
> - Improved performance
> - Reusable components
> - Unidirectional data flow
> - Dedicated tools for easy debugging
> #### Q: Components 
>  A: Components are the building blocks of any React application. A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately
> #### Q: Component Types 
>  A: Functional & Class
> #### Q: Redux (Optional) 
>  A: Redux is an open-source, JavaScript library used to manage the application state. React uses Redux to build the user interface. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used for the entire applicationâ€™s state management.
